# GertKanji
Android app to test your kanji knowledge

There are already a million kanji apps on the google store. I made this one so i could test my kanji in the same way that my language school does it's test. As a result I do not reccomend using this to learn, only for review and testing.
I have removed most of the excercises in this, since the database i used was not perfect and contained some mistakes. In the tools folder there is an extra C# project that i used to build my own database from a list of the Kanji per level (N5,N4,...) and the vocab.

Made in Android Studio and the database tool was built with C# in Visual Studio
